1	552616	PRJNA552616	Other	The plague agent, Yersinia pestis, employs a type III secretion system (T3SS) to selectively destroy human immune cells, thereby enabling its replication in the bloodstream and transmission to new hosts via fleabite. The host factors responsible for the selective destruction of immune cells by plague bacteria were not known. Here we show that LcrV, the needle cap protein of the Y. pestis T3SS, binds N-formylpeptide receptor (FPR1) on human immune cells to promote the translocation of bacterial effectors. Overall design: Y. pestis AM18, a DyfeAB variant of the vaccine strain EV76, is defective for iron and manganese scavenging. In broth cultures, Y. pestis AM18 secretes the T3SS effector named YopE via the lcrV-dependent T3SS pathway. Compared with the DlcrV variant (AM46), which cannot kill immune cells above control levels, Y. pestis AM18 infection resulted in modest killing of U937 human histiocytic leukemia cells differentiated into macrophages (U937 cells). Y. pestis POO1 is a variant of AM18 expressing yopE-dtx, a translational hybrid between the YopE effector and the mature domain of diphtheria toxin. Dtx is an ADP-ribosyltransferase that modifies elongation factor 2 (EF2) at its diphthamide residue to promote cell death. Y. pestis POO1 secretes YopE-Dtx and causes death of U937 macrophages in an lcrV-dependent manner. U937 cells were transduced with lentiviral libraries expressing RNA guided endonuclease Cas9 and short guide RNAs (sgRNA – 3 per gene) targeting 19,052 genes. After 12 hours of infection with Y. pestis POO1 or POO2 (yopE-dtx ΔlcrV), resistant cells were cultured with antibiotics to approximately 70% confluence and re-infected. The sgRNA sequences from surviving U937 cells were identified via next-generation sequencing (NGS) and candidate genes ranked based on the number of unique sgRNAs versus NGS reads. FPR1 stood out in three independent screens with the most abundant sgRNAs. FPR1 is a member of the GPCR family that activates immune cell chemotaxis and cytokine release in response to N-formylpeptides contained in bacteria or mitochondria.

7	545443	PRJEB29991	Other	The first historically documented pandemic caused by Yersinia pestis began as the Justinianic Plague in 541 within the Roman Empire and continued as the so-called First Pandemic until 750. Although paleogenomic studies have previously identified the causative agent as Y. pestis, little is known about the bacterium’s spread, diversity, and genetic history over the course of the pandemic. To elucidate the microevolution of the bacterium during this time period, we screened human remains from 21 sites in Austria, Britain, Germany, France, and Spain for Y. pestis DNA and reconstructed eight genomes. We present a methodological approach assessing single-nucleotide morphisms (SNPs) in ancient bacterial genomes, facilitating qualitative analyses of low coverage genomes from a metagenomic background. Phylogenetic analysis on the eight reconstructed genomes reveals the existence of previously undocumented Y. pestis diversity during the sixth to eighth centuries, and provides evidence for the presence of multiple distinct Y. pestis strains in Europe. We offer genetic evidence for the presence of the Justinianic Plague in the British Isles, previously only hypothesized from ambiguous documentary accounts, as well as the parallel occurrence of multiple derived strains in central and southern France, Spain, and southern Germany. Four of the reported strains form a polytomy similar to others seen across the Y. pestis phylogeny, associated with the Second and Third Pandemics. We identified a deletion of a 45-kb genomic region in the most recent First Pandemic strains affecting two virulence factors, intriguingly overlapping with a deletion found in 17th- to 18th-century genomes of the Second Pandemic.

8	534260	PRJNA534260	Transcriptome or Gene expression	Gasdermin-D (GSDMD) is cleaved by caspase-1/4/11 in response to canonical and non-canonical inflammasome activation. Upon cleavage, GSDMD oligomerizes and forms membrane pores, resulting in IL-1Î² secretion, pyroptotic cell death and inflammatory pathologies including periodic fever syndromes and septic shock â a plague on modern medicine. The transcriptional machinery that drives the expression of GSDMD is unknown. Here we show that IRF2, a member of the interferon-regulatory factor (IRF) family, is essential for the transcriptional activation of GSDMD. A forward genetic screen with ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU)-mutagenized mice unequivocally linked IRF2 to inflammasome signaling. Indeed, GSDMD transcript levels were highly attenuated in Irf2â/â macrophages upon Irf2 deficiency in macrophages, endothelial cells, and multiple organs, corresponding to attenuated IL-1Î² secretion and inhibited pyroptosis. Mechanistically, IRF2 binds a previously uncharacterized site within the GSDMD promoter to directly drive GSDMD transcription for execution of pyroptosis in response to canonical and non-canonical inflammasome activation. Our data illuminate a prominent transcriptional mechanism for the expression of GSDMD, a key mediator of inflammatory pathologies. Overall design: RNA was extracted from HOXB-8 cells for the following genotypes - Irf2 wild type (Parental) and Irf2 knock out(IRF2 KO).

Its pathogen, Borrelia recurrentis, shares a common vector with global killers, such as typhus and plague, and is known for its involvement in devastating historical epidemics, such as the Irish Potato Famine. Here, we describe a European and historical genome of B. recurrentis, recovered from a 15th-century skeleton from Oslo, Norway. Our distinct European lineage has a discrete genomic makeup, showcasing an ancestral oppA-1 gene and gene loss in antigenic variation sites.

35	475347	PRJEB24296	Other	The origin of Yersinia pestis and the early stages of its evolution are fundamental subjects of investigation given its high virulence and mortality that resulted from past pandemics. Although the earliest evidence of Y. pestis infections in humans has been identified in Late Neolithic and Bronze Age (LNBA 5000-3500y BP) individuals from Eurasia, these strains lack key genetic components required for flea adaptation, thus making their mode of transmission and disease presentation in humans unclear. Additionally, it has been previously suggested that Y. pestis did not become adapted to fleas until 3000 years ago. Here, we reconstruct ancient Y. pestis genomes from individuals associated with the Late Bronze Age (LBA) period (~3800 BP) in the Samara region of modern-day Russia. We show clear distinctions between our newly reported strains and the LNBA lineage, and suggest that the full ability for flea-mediated transmission causing bubonic plague evolved more than 1000 years earlier than previously suggested. Finally, we propose that several Y. pestis lineages were established during the Bronze Age, some of which have persisted to the present day.

45	450781	PRJEB25891	Other	For thousands of years, the Eurasian steppe has been a centre for human migrations and cultural change. To understand its population history following the Bronze Age migrations, we genome-sequenced 137 ancient humans (~1X average coverage) covering the past 4000 years. We find that Scythian groups that dominated the Eurasian steppe throughout the Iron Age, were highly structured, with diverse origins comprising Late Bronze Age herders, European farmers, and South Siberian hunter-gatherers. Later, Scythians admixed with eastern steppe nomads that formed the Xiongnu confederations, and moved westward in the ~3d/2nd century BCE, forming the Hun traditions in the 4th-5th century CE, carrying with them plague basal to the Justinian. These nomads were further admixed with East Asian groups during several short-term Medieval khanates. These historical events transformed the Eurasian steppe, from being inhabited by Indo-European speakers of largely western Eurasian ancestry, to the present-days mostly Turkic-speaking groups that are primarily of East Asian ancestry.

52	435238	PRJEB24937	Other	Recent ancient DNA (aDNA) studies of human pathogens have provided invaluable insights into their evolutionary history and prevalence in space and time. Most of these studies were based on DNA extracted from teeth or postcranial bones. In contrast, no pathogen DNA has been reported from the petrous bone which has become the most desired skeletal element in ancient DNA research due to to its high endogenous DNA content. To compare the potential for pathogenic aDNA retrieval from teeth and petrous bones, we sampled these elements from five ancient skeletons, previously shown to be carrying Y. pestis. Based on shotgun sequencing data, four of these five plague victims showed clearly detectable levels of Y. pestis DNA in the teeth whereas all the petrous bones failed to produce Y. pestis DNA above baseline levels. A broader comparative metagenomic analyses of teeth and petrous bones from 10 historical skeletons corroborated these results, showing a much higher microbial diversity in teeth than petrous bones, including pathogenic and oral microbial taxa. Our results imply that although petrous bones are highly valuable for ancient genomic analyses as an excellent source of endogenous DNA, the metagenomic potential of these dense skeletal elements is highly limited. This trade-off must be carefully considered when designing the sampling strategy for an aDNA project.

55	428012	PRJEB20658	Other	The Eurasian steppe, stretching about 8000 kilometres from Hungary and Romania in the west to Mongolia and western China in the east, is culturally among the most dynamic areas in the world. In the past four millennia, it has been variously dominated by Iranian-, Turkic- and Mongolic-speaking groups, and its temperate grasslands have been a crossroad for extensive movements of peoples, goods, and ideas between Europe, Siberia, South and East Asia. In order to understand the genetic history of the Eurasian steppe populations, we have sequenced 137 ancient genomes (~1X average coverage) spanning a 4000 years time series. We also genotyped 502 individuals from 16 contemporary self-reported ethnicities. We find evidence of a highly dynamic population history; the Iranian-speaking Scythians that dominated the Eurasian steppe throughout the Iron Age (~1 millennium BCE to common era) emerged following admixture between Late Bronze Age herders of western Eurasian descent and East Asian hunter-gatherers. The steppe nomads later further admixed with Turkic-speaking groups of East Asian ancestry that spread westward across the steppe in multiple waves: firstly, the Xiongnu confederations that emerged in Mongolia around the 3nd/2nd century BC; secondly, the Huns (4-5th century CE), infected with plague basal to the Justinian Y. pestis strain that destabilized the eastern Roman Empire in the 6th century CE; and thirdly during various short term dynasties, including the Mongol Empire of Genghis Khan and his descendants. These recent historical events transformed the Eurasian steppe populations from being Indo-European speakers of largely western Eurasian ancestry to the present-day Turkic-speaking groups, primarily of East Asian ancestry.

60	406910	PRJEB19335	Other	Yersinia pestis, the aetiologic agent of plague, is a bacterium associated with wild rodents and their fleas. Historically it was responsible for three pandemics: the Plague of Justinian in the 6th century AD which persisted until the 8th century; the renowned Black Death of the 14th century with recurrent outbreaks until the 18th century; and the most recent 19th century pandemic where Y. pestis spread world-wide and became endemic in several regions. The discovery of molecular signatures of Y. pestis in Prehistoric Eurasian individuals, and two genomes from Southern Siberia, suggest Y. pestis caused some form of disease in humans prior to the first historically documented pandemic. Here, we present six new European Y. pestis genomes spanning the Late Neolithic to the Bronze Age (LNBA; 4,800 to 3,700 calBP). This time period is characterized by major transformative cultural and social changes that led to cross-European networks of contact and exchange. We show that all known LNBA strains form a single putatively extinct clade in the Y. pestis phylogeny. Interpreting our data within the context of recent ancient human genomic evidence that suggests an increase in human mobility during the LNBA, we propose a possible scenario for the early spread of Y. pestis: the pathogen may have entered Europe from Central Eurasia following an expansion of people from the steppe, persisted within Europe until the mid-Bronze Age, and moved back towards Central Eurasia in parallel with human populations.

80	341663	PRJEB14851	Other	The Justinianic Plague, which started in the 6th century and lasted to the mid-8th century, is thought to be the first of three historically documented plague pandemics causing massive casualties. Historical accounts and molecular data suggest the bacterium Yersinia pestis as its etiological agent. Here we present a new high-coverage (17.9 fold) Y. pestis genome obtained from a 6th-century skeleton recovered from a southern German burial site close to Munich. The reconstructed genome enabled the detection of 30 unique substitutions as well as structural differences that have not been previously described. We report indels affecting a lacl family transcription regulator gene as well as non-synonymous substitutions in the nrdE, fadJ and pcp genes, that have been suggested as plague virulence determinants or have been shown to be up-regulated in different models of plague infection. In addition, we identify 19 false positive substitutions in a previously published lower coverage Y. pestis genome from another archaeological site of the same time period and geographical region that is otherwise genetically identical to the high coverage genome sequence reported here, suggesting low genetic diversity of the plague during the 6th century in rural southern Germany.

84	328937	PRJNA328937	Transcriptome or Gene expression	Pneumonic plague is the most deadly form of infection caused by Yersinia pestis and can progress extremely fast. However, our understanding on the host transcriptomic response to pneumonic plague is insufficient. Here, we used RNA-sequencing technology to analyze transcriptomic responses in mice infected with fully virulent strain 201 or EV76, a live attenuated vaccine strain lacking the pigmentation locus. Approximately 600 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were detected in lungs from both 201- and EV76-infected mice at 12 hours post-infection (hpi). DEGs in lungs of 201-infected mice exceeded 2,000 at 48 hpi, accompanied by sustained large numbers of DEGs in the liver and spleen; however, limited DEGs were detected in those organs of EV-infected mice. Remarkably, DEGs in lungs were significantly enriched in critical immune responses pathways in EV76-infected but not 201-infected mice, including antigen processing and presentation, T cell receptor signaling among others. Pathological and bacterial load analyses confirmed the rapid systemic dissemination of 201-infection and the confined EV76-infection in lungs. Our results demonstrate that fully virulent Y. pestis strongly inhibits both the innate and adaptive immune responses that are substantially stimulated in a self-limited infection, which update our holistic views on the transcriptomic response to pneumonic plague. Overall design: We used RNA-sequencing technology to analyze transcriptomic responses in lungs, spleen and liver of  mice infected with fully virulent strain 201 or EV76 at 12, 48 and 72 hpi.

85	328218	PRJNA328218	Other	Sequencing of the 3’ end of poly(A)+ RNA identifies cleavage and polyadenylation sites (pAs) and measures transcript expression. We previously developed a method, 3’ region extraction and deep sequencing (3’READS), to address mispriming issues that often plague 3’ end sequencing. Here we report a new version, named 3’READS+, which has vastly improved accuracy and sensitivity. Using a special locked nucleic acid oligo to capture poly(A)+ RNA and to remove bulk of the poly(A) tail, 3’READS+ generates RNA fragments with an optimal number of terminal As that balance data quality and detection of genuine pAs. With improved RNA ligation steps for efficiency, the method shows much higher sensitivity (over two orders of magnitude) compared to the previous version. Using 3’READS+, we have uncovered a sizable fraction of previously overlooked pAs located next to or within a stretch of adenylate residues in human genes, and more accurately assessed the frequency of alternative cleavage and polyadenylation (APA) in HeLa cells (~50%). 3’READS+ will be a useful tool to accurately study APA and to analyze gene expression by 3’ end counting, especially when the amount of input total RNA is limited. Overall design: Nine 3READS+ libraries were made with different amounts (100 ng, 200 ng, 400 ng, 1000 ng, 5000 ng, 15000 ng) of input Hela RNA.

102	324794	PRJEB13664	Other	Yersinia pestis is one of the most virulent bacterial pathogens known to humans. Here we deepen our knowledge of its history through the analysis of Y. pestis genomes from plague victims of the Black Death and two subsequent historical outbreaks. Our sample range spans Europe and its vicinity, namely Barcelona, Spain (1300-1420 cal AD), Bolgar City, Russia (1298-1388 cal AD), and Ellwangen, Germany (1485-1627 cal AD). Our results provide support for a single entry of plague during the Black Death, followed by a medieval wave of plague that traveled towards Asia to later become the source population for contemporary worldwide epidemics. In addition, our data from post-Black Death outbreaks are best explained by the presence of an historical European plague focus that is now likely extinct.

126	308707	PRJEB12163	Other	The 14th-18th century Yersinia pestis pandemic caused devastating epidemics in Europe for almost 400 years. The reasons for plague’s persistence and abrupt disappearance in Europe are poorly understood, but could have been due to either the presence of now-extinct plague foci in Europe itself, or successive disease introductions from other locations. Here we present five Y. pestis genomes from one of the last European outbreaks of plague, from 1722 Marseille, France. The lineage identified has not been found in any extant Y. pestis foci sampled to date, and has its ancestry in strains obtained from victims of the 14th century Black Death. These data suggest the existence of a previously uncharacterized historical plague focus within reach of Mediterranean port cities that persisted for at least three centuries. This disease source may have been responsible for the many resurgences of plague in Europe after the Black Death.

143	302843	PRJNA302843	Transcriptome or Gene expression	In Europe, the noble crayfish (Astacus astacus) is threatened by invasive North American crayfish species carrying and spreading the oomycete pathogen Aphanomyces astaci. The innate immune system of the noble crayfish is often too inefficient and slow to successfully combat the pathogen and infection leads to crayfish death usually within a few days or weeks. Thus, transcriptomic data for the identification of candidate genes are crucial for future genomic research aimed at understanding how the crayfish plague infection affects the innate immune system of noble crayfish. We generated RNA-seq data to assemble the complete transcriptome of the noble crayfish from four tissues (abdominal muscle, hepatopancreas, ovaries, antennal gland). This first transcriptome assembly is an important foundation for future genomic research on the noble crayfish when infected with the crayfish plague disease agent A. astaci.

144	299556	PRJEB10885	Other	The bacteria Yersinia pestis is the etiological agent of plague and has in historic times caused human pandemics with millions of deaths. How and when it originated remains contentious. Here, we report the oldest direct evidence of Yersinia pestis identified by ancient DNA in human teeth from Asia and Europe dating from 2,800 to 5,000 years ago. By sequencing the genomes, we find that these ancient plague strains are basal to all known Yersinia pestis. We find the origins of the Yersinia pestis lineage to be at least two times older than previous estimates. We also identify a temporal sequence of genetic changes that lead to increased virulence and the emergence of the Bubonic plague. Our results show that plague infection was endemic in the human populations of Eurasia at least 3,000 years before any historical recordings of pandemics.

161	289876	PRJNA289876	Transcriptome or Gene expression	Coral diseases are an ongoing and pervasive threat to corals and the reef ecosystems they build. Studies thus far have focused on assessing microbial communities or the identification of specific pathogens. The functional response of the coral metaorganism is at present unknown. To address this gap, we conducted the first metatranscriptomic analysis of the coral host, algal symbiont, and microbial compartments to survey holobiont structure and function in White Plague Disease. Our data show functionally linked responses across compartments, expression of genes associated with viral infection, and increased retroelement activity pointing towards epigenetic deregulation. This study devises an analytical framework for studying coral holobiont function by dissecting organismal response to the contribution of its member species.

162	289649	PRJNA289649	Transcriptome or Gene expression	During pneumonic plague, the bacterium Yersinia pestis elicits the development of inflammatory lung lesions that continue to expand throughout infection. This lesion development and persistence is poorly understood. Here, we examine spatially distinct regions of lung lesions using laser capture microdissection and RNAseq analysis to identify transcriptional differences between lesion microenvironments. We show that cellular pathways involved in leukocyte migration and apoptosis are down regulated in the center of lung lesions compared to the periphery. Probing for the bacterial factor(s) important for the alteration in neutrophil survival, we show both in vitro and in vivo that Y. pestis increases neutrophil survival in a manner that is dependent on the type-III secretion system effector YopM. This research explores the complexity of spatially distinct host - microbe interactions and emphasizes the importance of cell relevance in assays in order to fully understand Y. pestis virulence. Overall design: We examine spatially distinct regions of lung lesions using laser capture microdissection and RNAseq analysis to identify transcriptional differences between lesion microenvironments.  Sample types: uninfected BM-PMN, infected BM-PMN, lesion periphery, lesion center.

204	231221	PRJNA231221	Genome sequencing and assembly	In May 2014, the FDA and collaborators established a publicly available dAtabase for Reference Grade micrObial Sequences called FDA-ARGOS. With funding support from FDA’s Office of Counterterrorism and Emerging Threats (OCET) and DoD, the FDA-ARGOS team are initially collecting and sequencing 2000 microbes that include biothreat microorganisms, common clinical pathogens and closely related species.  Currently, FDA-ARGOS microbial genomes are generated in 3 phases. Generally:  Phase 1 entails collection of a previously identified microbe and nucleic acid extraction. Phase 2, the microbial nucleic acids are sequenced and de novo assembled using Illumina and PacBio sequencing platforms at the Institute for Genome Sciences at the University of Maryland (UMD-IGS). Phase 3, the assembled genomes are vetted by an ID-NGS subject matter expert working group consisting of FDA personnel and collaborators and the data are deposited in NCBI databases.    The FDA-ARGOS genomes meet the quality metrics for reference-grade genomes for regulatory use. FDA-ARGOS reference genomes have been de novo assembled with high depth of base coverage and placed within a pre-established phylogenetic tree. Each microbial isolate in the database is covered at a minimum of 20X over 95 percent of the assembled core genome. Furthermore, sample specific metadata, raw reads, assemblies, annotation and details of the bioinformatics pipeline are available.

We developed 3 region extraction and deep sequencing (3READS) to address mispriming issues that commonly plague poly(A) site (pA) identification, and we used the method to comprehensively map pAs in the mouse genome. Thorough annotation of gene 3 ends revealed over 5,000 previously overlooked pAs (~8% of total) flanked by A-rich sequences, underscoring the necessity of using an accurate tool for pA mapping. About 79% of mRNA genes and 66% of long noncoding RNA genes undergo APA, but these two gene types have distinct usage patterns for pAs in introns and upstream exons. Quantitative analysis of APA isoforms by 3READS indicated that promoter-distal pAs, regardless of intron or exon locations, become more abundant during embryonic development and cell differentiation and that upregulated isoforms have stronger pAs, suggesting global modulation of the 3 end–processing activity in development and differentiation.

244	67155	PRJNA67155	Genome sequencing	Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)  Yersinia. This genus consists of 11 species, 3 of which are human pathogens. Specific virulence factors are encoded within pathogenicity islands (PAIs) that are required for the invasive phenotype associated with Yersinia infections. These PAIs may be carried on extrachromosomal plasmids or on the chromosome. One key virulence plasmid contained by the three human-specific pathogens is pCD1/pYv, which encodes a type III secretion system for the delivery of virulence proteins that contribute to internalization into the host cell.  Yersinia pestis. This species was originally described by Institut Pasteur scientist Andre Yersin in 1894 in Hong Kong. It is the causative agent of plague (bubonic and pulmonary) a devastating disease which has killed millions worldwide. The organism can be transmitted from rats to humans through the bite of an infected flea or from human-to-human through the air during widespread infection. Yersinia pestis is an extremely pathogenic organism that requires very few numbers in order to cause disease, and is often lethal if left untreated. The organism is enteroinvasive, and can survive and propagate in macrophages prior to spreading systemically throughout the host. Yersinia pestis consists of three biotypes or serovars, Antiqua, Mediavalis, and Orientalis, that are associated with three major pandemics throughout human history. The first occurred during the first millenium, the second occurred from 1300 up to the 19th century (Black Death), and the third started in China during the 19th century and continues to this day. A fourth biovar type has been proposed, Microtus.   Yersinia pestis contains multiple copies of insertion elements, especially IS100, as compared to other Yersinia spp., and 2 species-specific plasmids, pMT1 and pPCP1. pMT1 encodes a protein, murine toxin, that aids rat-to-human transmission by enhancing survival of the organism in the flea midgut. Deep tissue invasion is due to the presence of a plasminogen activator encoded on the pPCP1 plasmid. Yersinia pestis also contains a PAI on the chromosome that is similar to the SPI-2 PAI from Salmonella that allows intracellular survival in the organism.     A1122. Strain A1122 grows on almost all isolates of Yersinia pestis and is used by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as a diagnostic agent for the causative agent of plague. The sample used for this project was obtained from the CDC.  	Sequencing	Yersinia pestis A1122	Whole	Genome	Monoisolate	Yersinia pestis A1122 genome sequencing project.

The CA88-4125 strain of Yersinia pestis is of great interest as it was originally isolated in Monterey County, California. This area is very close to San Francisco, where Y. pestis is first thought to have become established in native populations of rodents. Subsequent spread of plague to the rest of the western United States probably originated from this region. As such, comparisons of this strain to other North American Y. pestis strains should provide interesting insights into how Y. pestis mutated as it spread across the western United States.

Strain Angola belongs to a group of atypical Yersinia pestis strains with genotypic similarities that are intermediate between Y. pestis and Y. pseudotuberuclosis strains. Genotypic studies indicate that strain Angola is the oldest Y. pestis strain analyzed to date. It carries three plasmids that are similar to other Y. pestis plasmids but have aberrant sizes. The critical virulence factor, the V antigen, is different than that encoded by typical strains of Y. pestis and there is a deletion that affects the F1 operon. Strain Angola has been shown to be virulent by aerosol in mice.    Genome sequencing was at 8X coverage and was obtained from three libraries- a medium insert library (6-8 kb; 10,694 reads), a large insert library (10-12 kb; 45,354 reads), and a fosmid library (38-50 kb; 16,013 reads).

334	558715	PRJEB29990	Other	The second plague pandemic (14th - 18th century AD), caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis, is infamous for its initial wave, the Black Death (1346-1353 AD), and its repeated scourges in Europe and the vicinity until the Early Modern Era. Here, we report 32 ancient Y. pestis genomes spanning the 14th to 17th century AD through the analysis of human remains from nine European archaeological sites. Our data support an initial entry of the bacterium from Eastern Europe and the absence of genetic diversity during the Black Death as well as low diversity during local outbreaks thereafter. Moreover, analysis of post-Black Death genomes shows the diversification of a Y. pestis lineage into multiple genetically distinct clades that may have given rise to more than one disease reservoir in, or close to, Europe. Finally, we show the loss of a genomic region that includes virulence-associated genes in strains associated with late stages of the second plague pandemic (17th - 18th century AD). This deletion could not be detected in extant strains within our modern dataset, though it was identified in a today-extinct lineage associated with the first plague pandemic (6th - 8th century AD), suggesting convergent evolution during both pandemic events.

335	558084	PRJNA558084	Other	Yersinia pseudotuberculosis is a Gram-negative bacterium capable of causing gastrointestinal infection and is closely related to the highly virulent plague bacillus Yersinia pestis. Infection by both species are currently treatable with antibiotics such as ciprofloxacin, a quinolone-class drug of major clinical importance in the treatment of many other infections. Our current understanding of the mechanism of action of ciprofloxacin is that it inhibits DNA replication by targeting DNA gyrase, and that resistance is primarily due to mutation at this target site, along with generic efflux and detoxification strategies. We utilised transposon directed insertion site sequencing (TraDIS or TnSeq) to identify the non-essential chromosomal genes in Y. pseudotuberculosis that are required to tolerate sub-lethal concentrations of ciprofloxacin in vitro. As well as highlighting recognised antibiotic resistance genes, we provide evidence that a multitude of genes involved in regulating DNA replication and repair are central in enabling Y. pseudotuberculosis to tolerate the antibiotic, including dksA (yptb0734), a regulator of RNA polymerase and hda (yptb2792), an inhibitor of DNA replication initiation. We furthermore demonstrate that even at sub-lethal concentrations, ciprofloxacin causes severe cell-wall stress, requiring lipopolysaccharide lipid A, O-antigen and core biosynthesis genes to resist the sub-lethal effects of the antibiotic. It is evident that coping with the consequence(s) of antibiotic-induced stress requires the contribution of scores of genes that are not exclusively engaged in drug-resistance. Overall design: TnSeq was used to identify the non-essential chromosomal genes in Y. pseudotuberculosis that are required to tolerate sub-lethal concentrations of ciprofloxacin in vitro.

336	523610	PRJNA523610	Raw sequence reads	Here we present DNA isolation, rapid and field library preparation, and nanopore sequencing for Y. pestis and B. anthracis. Two commercially available DNA isolation kits were used to produce genomic DNA (gDNA) of sufficient quality and quantity for MinION WGS using both rapid and field library preparation methods. MinION reads are error-prone compared to Illumina and PacBio WGS data; containing more indels, particularly in homopolymer regions. When mutations are not located in homopolymeric regions, SNPs are accuratly called. Large and small plasmids are consistently assembled to completion from MinION data, with antimicrobial resistance genes encoded on these plamids readily identified. Expected and novel mulltimeric forms of the Y. pestis plasmid, pPCP1, were assembled, but these forms were not identified by Illumina or PacBio sequencing. A retrospective down sampling analysis revealed that 100,000 raw (.fast5) reads were sufficient for >99% coverage of B. anthracis and Y. pestis chromosomes and plasmids, as well as accurate detection of antimicrobial resistance markers and mutations. The ability sequence and analyze a Y. pestis or B. anthracis genome from a culture isolate in < 8.5 hours using nanopore sequencing could contribute to an expedited public health response.
