This demonstration explores the role digital exhibits play in on-going work as opposed to completed projects.

### There are 3 main points that have stood out as Iâ€™ve experimented with different platforms and datasets:

###
<pre>
   1. [Playgound of Ideas](https://nextstrain.org/community/narratives/ktmeaton/plague-phylogeography/DHSI2020Remote?n=3)
<br>
   2. [Interdisciplinary Perspectives](https://nextstrain.org/community/narratives/ktmeaton/plague-phylogeography/DHSI2020Remote?n=5)
<br>
   3. [Publish In Place](https://nextstrain.org/community/narratives/ktmeaton/plague-phylogeography/DHSI2020Remote?n=7)
</pre>
</p>

### We'll first begin with an introduction to this exhibit's format.

### You can navigate through the exhibit with the arrows at the top and bottom of this panel, by using your keyboard arrow keys, or by scrolling with your mouse.

### If you are viewing this as a video, the link to the exhibit is:

#### The exhibit in this demonstration explores a special form of a digital narrative.

#### Scrollable text is presented in the left panel, with exhibit items and contextual images presented in the right panel.

#### Just as in a traditional paper, the text and exhibit media should support each other.

#### An added benefit of digital publishing is that all images are hyperlinks, and when clicked, will take you to their source.

#### The image to the right depicts the London plagues in the 17th century, and accompanies an article about the surprising similarities bewteen past and modern pandemics.

#### The 'objects' in this exhibit are samples of the plague bacterium, *Yersinia pestis*.

#### This pathogenic organism causes the debilitating disease "Plague" which is infamous for causing historic pandemics such as the Black Death (14th century).

#### These plague samples were collected over a period of ~100 years and the DNA has been sequenced and made publicly available.

#### The DNA sequences were compared against each other to group similar samples together, creating a "disease network" or phylogenetic tree (middle panel).

#### As location data is available, the samples and their network can be plotted on a map (right panel).

#### To see more metadata, click EXPLORE THE DATA YOURSELF at the top right, and click a bubble in the middle panel.

## <b>Compare and Contextualize</b>

#### How does the spread network based on DNA evidence compare to maps based on archival sources?

<a href="https://doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.2.25362.25281">
  <img src="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Anne_Laudisoit2/publication/315837122/figure/fig1/AS:652961457897473@1532689551350/a-leftThe-origin-and-spread-of-Justinian-plague.png" width="80%">
        <p style='text-align: center;'>Origins and Spread of the Plague</p>
</a>

#### This map proposed the northward movement of plague from East Africa into the Mediterranean. This connection isn't observed in the map to the right, and East Asian samples (ex. China, Mongolia) instead have a more pronounced presence.

#### Why is there such a disparity?

## <b>Investigating Bias</b>

#### Exhibits can be a powerful platform for discovering underlying problems and asking new questions.

#### Recent human plague cases occurred most frequently in Madagascar, Congo, and Uganda.

<a href="https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2017/07/05/the-return-of-the-plague">
  <img src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/757/85/sites/default/files/20170708_WOM968_0.png" width="80%">
        <p style='text-align: center;'>Reported Human Plague Cases (2010-2015)</p>
</a>

#### Yet the DNA plague samples analyzed here don't reflect that. Instead there is a strong geographic bias towards samples collected in China.

#### Open up a new view commparing [disease networks from a study in 2010 vs. 2013](https://nextstrain.org/community/ktmeaton/plague-phylogeography/morelli2010Local:community/ktmeaton/plague-phylogeography/cui2013Local?c=BioSampleGeographicLocation&m=num_date). Mouse over "China" in the legend, and 4/13 bubbles (31%) will enlarge on the left side (2010) and 110/131 (84%) will appear on the right side (2013).

#### Considering how new studies influence the composition of public data is a critical part of digital scholarship.

## <b>Archaeology</b>

#### In contrast to geographic over-sampling, currently no European samples are included in this exhibit.

#### However, over 50 plague DNA samples have been retrieved from the remains of victims of ancient outbreaks.

#### A recent study even identified the plague bacterium in skeletal remains from [Sweden 4,900 years ago](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2018.11.005)!

## <b>Archives</b>

#### Additional integrations include digital humanties projects such as [Biraben 2.0: A Black Death Digital Archive](https://www.radcliffe.harvard.edu/seminars-and-workshops/biraben-black-death-digital-archive). This project involves the critique and digitzation of of 7,000 archival mentions of plague from the 14th-18th century.

## <b>Ecology</b>

#### In the accompanying data panel, plague samples collected from marmots (*Marmota*) have been highlighted.

#### Marmots live all throughout Asia, Europe, and North America. But it appears that plague has only been isolated from marmots found in China and Mongolia.

#### Datasets that are metadata-heavy can result in highly complex figures, or overly-simplified images where key information is missing.

#### The ability to publish and share interactive visuals is a strong point for modern digital exhibits, where layers and panels can be shown or hidden.

#### With the capability to incorporate text, you can freeze your idea playground in place and share it for feedback.

#### In some cases, this also reduces the burden of requiring collaborators to have expensive or complex software to view proprietary file types.

# [Conclusion](https://nextstrain.org/community/ktmeaton/plague-phylogeography/cui2013Remote)

#### My rewarding experiences working with digital exhibits tend to encompass three features.

#### 1. Many exhibit platforms can also serve as a tool for exploratory data analysis. Evoking the sensation of a [Playgound of Ideas](https://nextstrain.org/community/narratives/ktmeaton/plague-phylogeography/DHSI2020Remote?n=3) means feeling free to purse your research question, and to discover unexpected ones along the way.

#### 2. Having to distill each page down to basic takeaways with supporting literature/multimedia, can get you out of tunnel vision and incorporate more [Interdisciplinary Perspectives](https://nextstrain.org/community/narratives/ktmeaton/plague-phylogeography/DHSI2020Remote?n=5).

#### 3. Fusing multiple stages of the research process in one software, which can be easily shared, provides alternatives for a number of collaborative hurdles. The ability to [Publish in Place](https://nextstrain.org/community/narratives/ktmeaton/plague-phylogeography/DHSI2020Remote?n=7) without switching formats makes it more likely to get ideas out.
