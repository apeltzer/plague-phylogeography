abstract: "
'The Plague' is a mystifying and devastating disease that has re-emerged multiple times throughout history. From the Plague of Justinian (6th century) to the Madagascar Plague Outbreak (2017), this infectious disease has resulted in exceptional mortality and societal upheaval.

### While our knowledge of plague has grown tremendously, there are many outstanding questions:
<br><br>
1. __Where__ did the ancient pandemics originate?  
<br>
2. __When__ might modern plague foci re-activate?  
<br>
3. __Why__ does plague no longer exist in Western Europe?
<br>
4. __How__ does a city respond to losing 50% of its population?
<br><br>

### The mysteries of plague bring together researchers from a wide variety of disciplines from art history to microbiology. While each field stands to make a unique contribution, there remains a unified fascination over how people are affected and cope with this disease, as well as where, when, and why it suddenly appears...

# [Origins: The Ancient Plagues](http://localhost:4000/plague150Local?d=map)
#### The plagues of the ancient world have intriguing geographic origins.

#### Early hypotheses on the 'origins' of the ancient pandemics varied greatly including regions in Central and East Africa, the Middle East, as well as Western and Central Asia [(Dols, 1974](https://www.jstor.org/stable/600071); [Dols, 1979](https://www.jstor.org/stable/3631953); [Benedictow, 2010)](https://books.google.ca/books/about/The_Black_Death_1346_1353.html?id=KjLHAOE7irsC).<br>

# The Power of Maps

#### Iconic maps produced in the mid-20th century have largely influenced the discussion of geographic and temporal spread of plague [(Mengel, 2011)](https://academic.oup.com/past/article-abstract/211/1/3/1381253). The historical sources used to estimate plague mortality consist of documents such as parish records, financial transactions, wills, and local testimonies [(Christakos et al. 2005)](https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783540257943).

### However, these source documents can be of poor quality or are sparsely found leading to high levels of uncertainty [(Skog and Hauska, 2013)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1467-9671.2012.01369.x). As a result, the historical sources used in the construction of these maps are experiencing renewed critical re-examination  [(Bossak and Welford, 2015)](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/e/9781315610252/chapters/10.4324%2F9781315610252-12).

# [Origins: Through a New Lens](http://localhost:4000/plague150Local?d=map&animate=1400-01-01,2017-01-01,0,1,30000)
#### In contrast to the historical perspective, genetic evidence offers a very different narrative.

### Advances in DNA sequencing have made it possible to rapidly sequence the genome of the plague bacterium *Yersinia pestis* from outbreak sources across the globe.

#### By examining the relationships between modern plague outbreaks, researchers demonstrated that plague evolved in or near East Asia with multiple global radiations throughout history [(Morelli et al. 2010)](https://www.nature.com/articles/ng.705).

#### Not only that, ancient plague DNA can be retrieved from victims of past epidemics, providing new windows into the past.
